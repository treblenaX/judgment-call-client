    REVIEW:`
Why do you think your stakeholder would review your scenario with the ratine that you were given? Take about 10 minutes to independently write a review based on the principle given. 
        
        A couple of tips for writing great reviews:
            - Empathize with your stakeholder
            - Be specific about the benefits and/or harms
            - Don't hold back - be expressive!
        
Here's an example:
        Scenario: Facial Recognition at the Airport
        Stakeholder: Security Employee
        Principle: Reliability
        Rating: 1 star (out of 5)
        Review: 
            This system is even worse than the old body scanners! It constantly needs to be updated and each time we have to take it offline and re-certify it before we can start using it again. When it's running, it works well, we haven't had any security incidents. But each month it goes offline for about 3 days to update and re-certify.

    DISCUSSION: `
Reviews can lightheartedly surface serious oversight and potential problems. Use the group discussion to dig further into emerging themes, benefits, and/or harms noted in the reviews. Ask yourselves questions as you move deeper into the potential real-world ramifications, start to think about applying these explorations to future product development.

    1. What are the potential benefits or harms?
    2. Were there recurring themes?

Start thinking about how to mitigate the issues and empower the benefits, and get ready to talk about it in the 'Mitigation' phase after this.
    `,
    MITIGATION: `
Choose one stakeholder, benefit, harm, or theme that stood out in the discussion. Based on the stakeholder experiences and what you talked about in your discussions, how could the product be changed to prevent these problems? Consider both technical and social solutions.
    `,
    JUDGMENT_CALL: `
You've considered a wide range of perspectives, surfaced potential harms, and explored preventative design measures. Now it's time to make a judgment call.

Moving forward, what's the best solution for making a better product?
